  """Repository of stateful objects, which are stored and retrieved by state.

  The objects (_Obj) can be arbitrary objects, i.e., not necessarily copiable or
  serializable, etc., as long as there is a way of constructing a new object
  instance for a given state on demand. The state (_ObjState) should be an
  immutable / hashable / copiable / serializable representation of the object's
  internal state.

  The canonical motivating example is where the object is a PythonSandbox, whose
  internal state can be represented in terms of the sequence of code blocks that
  have been executed on that sandbox up till now. In that case, we would have:
    _Obj=PythonSandbox
    _ObjState=tuple[str, ...]

  Attributes:
    create_object_function: Function for creating a new object corresponding to
      a given state. The cache will use this function to create new objects on
      demand whenever there is a cache miss.
    destroy_object_function: If specified, the cache will call this function on
      each object that it owns when the cache is destroyed, or when the given
      object is explicitly discarded.

  # TODO: Configure a maximum size of the cache (e.g., `max_size` and
  # `max_size_per_state`), track the last accessed time of each object, and when
  # the cache is full, automatically discard the least recently used object.
  # Conceptually this would mean maintaining a kind of LRU cache of stateful
  # objects. Note that it may not be strightforward to use an off-the-shelf
  # LRU cache implementation like `cache_tools.LRUCache`, however, due to the
  # following requirements:
  # * We can potentially have multiple different objects corresponding to the
  #   same state (e.g., if we are caching Python sandboxes, and if we have
  #   multiple parallel execution branches that request a Python sandbox in
  #   identical state, we may need to temporarily create multiple such identical
  #   sandboxes so that each execution branch has control of its own; if in the
  #   next step those execution branches happen to each execute the same piece
  #   of code, then when the sandboxes get returned to the cache, we will end up
  #   with multiple cached sandbox instances associated with the same state).
  # * We need to automatically destroy the object in the case where it is
  #   automatically discarded by the LRU cache, but would not want to destroy it
  #   in the case where it is popped from the LRU cache in the usual way for the
  #   purpose of being lent out.
  # * Separately from the objects cached by state, we need to also keep track of
  #   the objects that are currently lent out (and which are not associated with
  #   any given state), so that they can so that we can ensure that all objects
  #   owned by the cache are cleaned up properly when the cache itself is
  #   destroyed, even if for some reason some of the objects never got re-cached
  #   after being lent out.

  # The objects that were created by the cache (plus any other objects for which
  # the cache took over ownership). The cache will control the life cycle of the
  # objects internally and will create new ones on demand using the
