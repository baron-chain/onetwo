"""Implementation of variations of the self-consistency strategy.

Generalized from the ideas of the self-consistency paper:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11171

The basic idea of self-consistency as presented in the original paper is to
generate multiple samples using chain-of-thought or some other strategy
involving diverse reasoning paths; extract a normalized answer from each sample;
and then do majority voting over the answers.

Here we reformulate self-consistency as a meta-strategy that wraps some
underlying strategy that outputs a single answer (typically via some kind of
reasoning path or other intermediate steps) and converts it into a strategy that
outputs a marginal distribution over possible answers (marginalizing over the
intermediate steps). The marginal distribution is estimated via repeated
sampling from the underlying strategy.

Supported variations include:
* Self-consistency over chain-of-thought (like in the original paper).
* Self-consistency over a multi-step prompting strategy (e.g., ReAct).
* Self-consistency over a multi-arg strategy (e.g., Retrieval QA).
* Self-consistency over diverse parameterizations of the underlying strategy
  (e.g., with samples taken using different choices of few-shot exemplars,
   as in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02336).
* Self-consistency over diverse underlying strategies.
* Self-consistency with answer normalization applied during bucketization.
* Self-consistency with weighted voting
  (as in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02336).
* Evaluation based on the consensus answer alone.
* Evaluation based on the full answer distribution (e.g., accuracy@k).
* Evaluation taking into account a representative reasoning path.

class SelfConsistency(Generic[_O, _Bucket]):
  """Self-consistency strategy, which can wrap an arbitrary inner strategy.

  If the inner strategy maps inputs (_Args) to output (_O), the self-consistency
  variant of it will take inputs (_Args) and return a distribution over possible
  outputs (i.e., `list[tuple[_O, float]]`). The caller can then either use the
  full distribution directly (e.g., for calculating a metric like accuracy@k),
  or take the top-weighted candidate output as the single "consensus answer".

  The float values in the output represent arbitrary scores (not necessarily
  probabilities), but can be converted into probabilities by dividing by the
  sum of the scores.

  The implementation is parameterized by several components: `sampler`,
  `output_filter`, `scorer`, `bucketizer`, etc. The only required one is
  `sampler`, as the rest all have default implementations, which are sufficient
  for performing the basic self-consistency strategy, as described in the
  original paper. Each of the components can be provided in the form of either
  an ordinary function or an async function.

  Attributes:
    sampler: The inner strategy that is used for generating each prediction.
    num_samples: Number of candidate predictions to sample before voting.
    output_filter: A function that takes a candidate output and returns True if
      it should be included in the distribution. Could be used, for example, to
      filter out `None` values. By default, no filtering is applied.
    scorer: A function that takes a pair of inputs + candidate output and
      returns a score. By default, it just gives a vote of 1.0 for each
      candidate.
    bucketizer: A function that takes a candidate output and returns a bucket.
      Candidates placed in the same bucket are considered to be "equivalent" for
      purposes of voting and of determining the distribution of outputs.
    representative_output_selector: A function that selects a single
      representative out of all of the candidates within a given bucket. The sum
      of the scores of all the candidates in that bucket will be considered the
      total score for that single representative output.
