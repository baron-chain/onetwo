  """Options for token healing.

  Token healing is a technique that can often significantly improve generation
  results (or rather help to avoid erroneous results). Consider prompts ending
  with a whitespace, e.g., "Theory of ". Depending on the model and the
  tokenizer, this string is likely to be encoded into a token sequence where the
  last element is a whitespace token (WT) corresponding to a single whitespace "
  ". The model will then generate next tokens, following WT. An issue with this
  scenario is that words are often tokenized together with the leading
  whitespace. Likely, there is " relativity" token (RT) and for the majority of
  sentenses where the word "relativity" (case-sensitive!) occured, it was
  encoded into RT. So the model may be very "familiar" with RT, but not with
  "relativity" token (no space). Unfortunately, a separate whitespace token
  already appears in the end of the sequence, so the model can't generate RT
  (indeed, two whitespaces in a row is very uncommon, so the model won't do it)
  and instead generates something else (that often looks odd). This phenomenon
  is more general and can occur with other tokens in the end of the prompt as
  well. For more details refer to https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance.

  # to completion. In the ideal scenario where constrained decoding is available
  # we make sure that the string representation of the first token that we
  # generate contains the string representation of the removed token as a
  # prefix. This way we guarantee that the completion matches user's
  # expectations and we avoid token boundary artifacts at the same time. If the
  # constrained decoding is not available for the model we sample completions
  # in hope that the constraint will be satisfied and roll back to vanilla
  # completion in case of failure.
